# Calendar
Fun Little Calendar Project
This will be my project I keep building on for a little bit then I will build another project shortly after.
All calendars are currently Gregorian until further notice
Feature List: Create and save calendars in a file for personal use, view calendar for any month of any year. Maybe eventually you can view a whole year's calendar by typing desired month? Maybe.
This is just supposed to be a fun little beginnerish project.

Current Featureset:Create and save calendar, view calendar for any month and year

Goals For Future Updates: Add in French Republican (Revolutionar) Calendar, Full year calendar, Colors for Calendars
