# Calendar
Fun Little Calendar Project (Not complete)
This will be my project I keep building on for a little bit then I will build another project shortly after.
All calendars are currently Gregorian until further notice
Feature List: Create and save calendars in a file for personal use, view calendar for any month of any year. Maybe eventually you can view a whole year's calendar by typing desired month? Maybe.
This is just supposed to be a fun little beginnerish project.
